<h3> <b> More about this Application </b> </h3>  

Project is for a hiking group in Rinjani, Indonesia. Essentially for a team of trekkers that are looking for people to pay packages to go on climbs and hikes. 
I tried to write most of the javascript and jquery but couldn't because of certain frameworks. I also tried to be a bit creative with the CSS. 
I deviated from the standard bootstrap to try and fit that zig-zag line I think it works if you think of it as a trail, like a hike from point A to D. Most of the project is in bootstrap.<br>

The project ended up looking very different when deployed to heroku. Different size images, bad fitting, strange font. I used composer to get the static pages
onto heroku. There are two forms with minimal feedback (e.g. ''success you're logged in"). Theres a contact page but it turned out very ugly on heroku.
There's pages for all the trails, a home page and a log/log-out page. I suggest looking at the raw html before going on heroku. I ddin't expect it to turn out like that at all.


<h3> <b> Deployment </b> </h3>


The full application was deployed and is hosted on Heroku using the gunicorn package (Python). Gunicorn will initialize the HTTP address for the application on a webserver. </h4>
